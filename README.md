An npm package providing a validator for [Amazon States Language](https://states-language.net/spec.html) JSON files. Usable from the command-line or as a library.

This package is derived from Amazon Web Services Labs' [awslabs/statelint](https://github.com/awslabs/statelint) and is up to date with [Amazon States Language](https://states-language.net/) as of [September 7, 2023](https://states-language.net/#september-7-2023).

## From the Command-line 

### Installation
```sh
npm install --global @wmfs/statelint
```

### Usage
```javascript
statelint state-machine-spec [state-machine-spec...]
```

There are no options. If you see no output, your state machine is fine.

## As a library 

### Installation
```sh
npm install --save @wmfs/statelint
```

### Usage
```javascript
const stateLint = require('@wmfs/statelint')

const problems = stateLint.validate(json)
if (problems.length !== 0) {
  console.log('Oh dear!')
  problems.forEach(p => console.log(`ERROR: ${p}`)
}
```

* `json` is the state machine to validate as a JSON object.

`stateLint.validate` returns an array or error strings. If the array is empty, the state machine is fine. If not, then there's a problem! The validator is exhaustive, so it will report every problem it finds, not simply bail at the first thing. The error messages have the general form `<json-path to error> <description of error>`.
